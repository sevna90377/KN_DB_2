Database app for Science Circle management.

I was challenged to implement this for console app and somehow I managed. I believe this solution to be pretty sophisticated, as I managed to minimise the workload while maintaining functionality. 
Database have been normalised to 3NF and implemented in postgress. Recreated in dotnet using scaffolding, very convenient tool. I didn't have time to figure out how to properly share database for github yet.
